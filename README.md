# Periodic Tables

[Test Out the App](https://www.markdownguide.org)


This application exists for the restaurant industry. The typical user would be the employee(s) in charge of managing reservations and tabling at a restaurant. With Periodic tables, the user can easily: 

- See existing reservations
- Record a new reservation
- Update an old reservation with new information
- Enter a new table
- "Seat" a reservation at a free table, thus making that table "occupied"
- "Finish" a reservation's tabling when they have completed their meal. This moves the table back from "occupied" to "free" and removes the reservation from the database.
